<p>Welcome to the deck scripts of the application.</p>

<h1>***WARNING!!!!!***</h1>
<p>DO NOT DO ANYTHING WITH THE FILES HERE UNLESS YOU KNOW PYTHON!!!</p>

<h1>Instructions for use:</h1>
First, keep the __init.py and __init__.pyc files in this folder as they are needed for the deck to see the decks here.
second, you can put any files here, but a large number of .py files may slow down the program a little at startup as it searches through all the .py files for the line:
deck_list = []
Every file should have the above line with your decks inbetween the brackets [deck1, deck2, deck3, deck4]. You can have as many decks as you wish in a file. You can also create another folder inside this folder without an __init__.py file and store all your unfinished decks in it. The program will not see them.

<h1>What scripting options are there</h1>
You can create decks with:
all kinds of background colors (using rgb values), color of text, color of the background of the text...
you can add pictures to the background, you can add your own font files, you can add sounds and mp3, ogg or wav files to your programs, you can add options, key short-cuts, text to speech voices and all kinds of things to each side of the card.

<h2>The deck structure</h2>
There are global settings for each deck and then there are spacific settings for each card and then settings for each side of the card. The order of prefference is:
side,
card,
deck.
so if you set in the deck for all cards to have an orange background and you wanted card number 3 to have a green front and yellow background, you can do that.

Yeah yeah lets get to the good stuff!
